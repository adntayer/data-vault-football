# Data Model

## Introduction

The Football Data Vault employs the Data Vault modeling approach to organize and manage football-related data effectively. This document provides an overview of the core concepts of the Data Vault model and how they are applied in the context of football data.

## Core Components

**1. Hubs**

**Definition**: Hubs represent the central business entities in the data model and serve as the single source of truth for their respective domains. They store unique instances of business objects and are characterized by their simplicity and stability. Hubs contain hub keys, which are surrogate keys generated by the system to uniquely identify records, along with descriptive attributes that provide additional context about the entity.

**Application**: In the Football Data Vault, hubs are utilized to represent entities such as teams, players, and matches. For example, the "Team Hub" contains records for each football team, including attributes such as team name, country, and formation.

**Example**: The "Team Hub" includes records for popular football clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Barcelona. Each record contains a unique hub key and descriptive attributes such as team name, country, and formation.

**2. Links**

**Definition**: Links establish relationships between hubs and capture the associations and connections between different entities. They represent the many-to-many relationships that exist between business objects and enable the modeling of complex relationships within the data model. Links contain link keys, which are generated to uniquely identify relationships between hubs, along with any descriptive attributes that characterize the relationship.

**Application**: In football data, links are used to connect teams with players (Team-Player Link) and matches with participating teams (Match-Team Link). For instance, the "Team-Player Link" associates each player with the team(s) they belong to, along with attributes such as the player's position and jersey number.

**Example**: The "Team-Player Link" establishes connections between players and their respective teams. For example, it links Lionel Messi to FC Barcelona with additional attributes such as position (forward) and jersey number (10).

**3. Satellites**

**Definition**: Satellites store additional context and descriptive details about hubs and links. They capture the history of changes to hub and link attributes over time, enabling the tracking of changes and updates to data. Satellites are designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for the storage of various types of information, including historical versions of data attributes, audit information, and metadata.

**Application**: Satellites in the Football Data Vault contain historical and descriptive information about teams, players, matches, and their respective relationships. This allows for the tracking of changes and updates to data attributes over time.

**Example**: The "Team Satellite" stores historical data such as team rankings, performance statistics, and coaching staff changes over time. For instance, it tracks changes in the ranking of FC Barcelona throughout different seasons along with attributes such as points, goals scored, and managerial changes.

## Core Concepts
